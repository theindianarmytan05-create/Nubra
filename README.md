## 🏢 Project Context

This project was developed as part of a **competitive hiring challenge** conducted by **Zenskar Securities** for the **Data Analyst role** during the college placement process.  
Participants were tasked with building an **end-to-end data-driven Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy** for the **Nubra Financial Platform**, focusing on engaging India’s engineering community in trading and investment behavior.

---

## 📘 Overview

The **Nubra GTM Strategy Project** focuses on designing a structured, analytics-based market entry and user growth plan.  
It leverages multiple public datasets and synthesizes realistic engagement data to forecast **adoption, conversion, and retention patterns** over a 12-month GTM cycle.

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview

**Data Sources:**
- Stack Overflow Developer Survey → Developer demographics and skills  
- AISHE → Indian student enrollment and college data  
- NIFTY & NSE → Market participation and financial trends  

**Dataset Size:** `~200,000 records`

| Category | Example Features |
|-----------|------------------|
| Demographics | city, state, college, role, years_experience |
| Technical Activity | github_public_repos, stackoverflow_score |
| Platform Engagement | sandbox_depositor, backtests_run, strategy_saves, live_trades_count |
| Market Context | nifty_1y_return_pct, monthly_nse_account_count |
| Channel Source | source_used_stackoverflow, source_used_aishe, source_used_nifty |

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Despite India’s vast engineering base, engagement in trading remains under-penetrated.  
**Nubra** lacks a structured GTM framework to:
- Quantify the real addressable market  
- Identify engagement levers for engineers  
- Convert learning activity into live trading  
- Track retention through measurable KPIs  

---

## 🧭 Project Aim

To develop a **phased, data-driven GTM roadmap** for Nubra that:
1. Quantifies market potential (TAM, SAM, SOM)  
2. Segments engineers by experience and engagement type  
3. Defines actionable growth campaigns for adoption, conversion, and retention  
4. Establishes KPIs for continuous tracking and optimization  

---

## 🧩 Objectives

1. Market sizing and funnel analysis  
2. Engineer segmentation and profiling  
3. 12-month GTM strategy blueprint  
4. Campaign design and KPI mapping  
5. Monitoring framework for adoption-to-retention flow  

---

## 📊 Key Insights

| Insight | Observation |
|----------|--------------|
| **Market Size** | ~2.3M engineers (301K students, 1.99M professionals) |
| **Awareness** | 28% sandbox depositors, only 8% live traders |
| **Geographic Focus** | Delhi NCR, Bengaluru, Pune, Chennai, Hyderabad |
| **Funnel Drop-off** | Sharp drop between signup → sandbox → live trade |
| **Engagement Gap** | Low backtesting and strategy publishing rates |

---

## 🗓️ 1-Year GTM Execution Plan

| Phase | Duration | Focus | Core Activities | Key KPIs |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **Phase 1 – Awareness** | Month 1–3 | Education & Onboarding | Gamified sandbox, webinars, portfolio workshops | Sandbox adoption rate, event participation |
| **Phase 2 – Conversion** | Month 4–6 | From curiosity to action | Personalized nudges, reward tiers, mentorships | Sandbox→Live conversion, strategy count |
| **Phase 3 – Expansion** | Month 7–9 | Scale reach | College partnerships, referral programs | New user acquisition, retention rate |
| **Phase 4 – Retention** | Month 10–12 | Sustain engagement | Leaderboards, feedback loops, advanced dashboards | Retention %, LTV growth, feature engagement |
